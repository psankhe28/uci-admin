- Sunbird UCI democratizes the usage of WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, and email by giving governments the ability to control communications with residents and authorities across many channels. 
- The logging and statistics for the notification triggering process are currently unavailable. Obtaining this data requires manual efforts, creating a dependency on an engineer to retrieve the necessary information.
- Therefore, the goal of telemetry dashboard is to keep track of them, which will make it easier for everyone involved in it to comprehend the statistics.
